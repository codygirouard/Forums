# Denton Forums | [dentonforums.com](https://www.dentonforums.com)

Denton Forums enables Denton, Texas citizens to discuss just about anything as a community. The forums lets users create accounts, which gives them the ability to make comments, posts, and like posts.

Denton Forums was created using the MERN technology stack. The main reasoning for using this tech stack was the popularity of it in the industry. The stack made development simple, fast, and efficient. 

For the future, I plan on implementing user profiles, friends list (showing who is online), and direct messaging between friends.
